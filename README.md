# Game

Temporary README until I figure out more details to what I want to create. So far, it's supposed to be an auto-battler with procedurally generated enemies and levels.

For now, things are pretty barebones.

Controller handles the main game loop and is the bridge between the view and the model. It handles user input as well.

The model handles game logic and game states.

The view handles basic rendering and asset loading. Will also handle animations.
